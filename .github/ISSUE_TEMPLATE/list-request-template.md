name: List Request Template
about: Request that Taskforge support a new service as a List

---

## What is the name of the Service you would like implemented?

For example "GitHub" or "MongoDB"

## Is it a 3rd party service or a database?

Is this some proprietary / external service or a database?

### If it is a database does it have a Python Driver?

Will we have to build a driver, use an open source driver, or is there a
supported driver for this database?

### If it is a 3rd party service does it have an API or does it have a Python API wrapper package?

Will we have to wrap their API or is that work done for us?

### Why do you want this list

For example "My team uses this service so I need it to integrate taskforge at work"

### What new workflows would it enable

If there is anything this service provides that makes Taskforge more useful. For
example "MongoDB can be used with MongoDB Charts to generate custom reports on
task data."
